###11 / 01 / 2017 : Did not code anything..... Feeling exhausted ..... Hope to have a fresh start tomorrow
###12 / 01 / 2017 : Solved Sherlock And The Array (Search) ... The mistake in previous solution was recalculating sum of the array O(n).... Fixed that be memorising Left sum and Right Sum
###15 / 01 / 2017 : No code today went to watch EIC
###16 / 01 / 2017 : Solved Pairs (Search) .... The mistake in previous solution was O(n^2) .... Reduced the complexity to O(nlogn)
